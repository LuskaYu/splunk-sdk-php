# The Splunk Software Development Kit for PHP (Preview)

This SDK contains library code and examples designed to enable developers to
build applications using Splunk.

Splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed
map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search and process large 
time-varying data sets.

The Splunk product is popular with system administrators for aggregation and
monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance and a wide variety of other
scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index, search, analyze and
generate real-time notifications from large volumes of time series data.

The Splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the same
technology used by the Splunk product to build exciting new applications that
are enabled by Splunk's unique capabilities.
